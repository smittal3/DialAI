I understand you received financial support from FundANeed Foundation last month. Could you confirm this?\nCustomer: Yes, that's correct. We received Rs. 50,000 to help with my daughter's college fees at Delhi University.\nAgent: Thank you for confirming. Could you tell me how helpful these funds were and what specific expenses they covered?\nCustomer: The funds were extremely helpful. My husband's small business was affected during COVID, and we were struggling with our savings. The money helped cover my daughter's first semester fees and her hostel deposit. She's studying B.Tech in Computer Science.\nAgent: I'm glad to hear the funds were helpful. Is there any other way FundANeed could have supported you and your family?\nCustomer: Well, it would have been helpful if they could provide some guidance about other scholarship opportunities or maybe some career counseling services for students. Many families like us are new to the college admission process.\nAgent: That's valuable feedback. Lastly, do you have any other suggestions or feedback for FundANeed Foundation?\nCustomer: Yes, the process was good, but it would be better if the application process was available in Hindi as well. Also, maybe they could create a WhatsApp group for beneficiaries to share information and opportunities. Otherwise, I'm very grateful for their support.\nAgent: Thank you so much for your time and detailed feedback, Mrs. Sharma. This will help us improve our services. Have a good day!\nCustomer: Thank you, you too. Goodbye.",

You've been a beneficiary of our program, and we're interested in hearing about your experience, specifically how it has impacted your children. Can you tell me a little bit about that?\nCustomer: Good and I appreciated the money but I could use some more.\nAgent: I'm glad to hear that the cash transfer was helpful.

For example, were you able to buy them food, clothes, or pay for their education?",

      "transcript": "Agent: Hello, I'm calling from FundANeed Foundation. Is this Mrs. Gupta?\nCustomer: Yes, speaking.\nAgent: We're following up about the educational support approved for your daughter's college fees. Could you confirm if you received the funds?\nCustomer: No, I haven't received anything yet. I've been checking my account daily. The college is asking for fees next week.\nAgent: Our records show the amount was transferred last week to the account ending in 4573.\nCustomer: That's my old account. I provided the new account details when the bank merged. I submitted a letter about this change.\nAgent: When did you submit this update?\nCustomer: Two months ago at your local office. They said they would update it. I've been trying to call but no one answers. My daughter might lose her seat if we don't pay by next week.",
